1. Create new branch e.g quynh_le_test

2. In practice1, instead of getting first and last 
element, you have to get all elements at odd index.
For example: I assume the given list was: 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
New list should be: [1, 3, 5, 7]

3. Push your commit to the branch quynh_le_test

4. Merge this commit to master branch
